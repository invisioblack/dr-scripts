🛠️ Disable Power Saving on an ASUS ROG Laptop
🔹 Step 1: Disable Wi-Fi Power Saving
Press Windows + X → select Device Manager.

Expand Network adapters.

Right-click the Wi-Fi adapter (e.g., Intel AX200), then click Properties.

Go to the Power Management tab.

Uncheck: “Allow the computer to turn off this device to save power.”

Click OK.

🔹 Step 2: Set Wireless to Maximum Performance
Press Windows + S, search for Edit power plan, and open it.

Click “Change advanced power settings.”

Expand Wireless Adapter Settings → Power Saving Mode.

Set both On battery and Plugged in to Maximum Performance.

Click Apply → OK.

🔹 Step 3: Set Power Plan to High Performance (or Ultimate)
Press Windows + X → Power Options.

Under Preferred plans, choose High performance or ASUS Recommended (check if it says “Performance” or “Turbo”).

If only "Balanced" is listed:

Open Command Prompt (Admin).

Run:

Edit
powercfg -duplicatescheme e9a42b02-d5df-448d-aa00-03f14749eb61
This adds the Ultimate Performance plan. Select it in Power Options.

🔹 Step 4: Disable Fast Startup (Optional but Helps Stability)
Press Windows + S, search “Choose what the power buttons do”, and open it.

Click “Change settings that are currently unavailable.”

Uncheck: “Turn on fast startup (recommended).”

Click Save changes.

🔹 Step 5: Set Armoury Crate to Turbo or Performance
Open Armoury Crate (should be pre-installed).

Go to Device → System Configuration or Power Profiles.

Select Turbo or Performance mode.

Avoid Silent or Battery Saver modes—they throttle everything.

Check for “Background App Management” and disable anything that restricts network or system performance.

💥 Bonus: Disable USB Selective Suspend (Helps With Sleep Issues)
Back in Advanced Power Settings, expand:

USB settings → USB selective suspend setting

Set both On battery and Plugged in to Disabled.

With all that locked in, her laptop should stop playing dead during idle moments, and the Wi-Fi should stay steady even during long in-game sessions.
